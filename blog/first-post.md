# Welcome to the First Blog of Klein Panic

## The New Website
I made a new website! If you're reading this you're on it. It's kleinpanic.com. I hope this website can be used to store all of my projects, and allow the online universe to get to know me (within reason). 
I wanted to share a little about this website. I am starting to add support for W3m and Lynx browsers, but currently I have default for larger windows on all visual based web browsers (I think). Next step is to get it to look better for the mobile enviornment but for now I'm content. 
Currently we have support for Curl! Curl https://kleinpanic.com to see all my project, and curl https://kleinpanic.com/ip to checkout your IP address! I have to improve the bash install script that is used for the curl install portion of this website but that is a problem for the future. 
I plan on posting more about this website, changes I make to, advacements. I also want to start posting about the coding projects I make and the videos I create. 

## The New Youtube channel.

I just like that image and wanted to share it, but also right now it is the face of my youtube! Checkout the new youtube at https://www.youtube.com/@KleinPanic! I just made my first video tonight, talking about the linux/GNU os, common distros and a short overview of some gnu core utils!
The youtube will hopefully be able to be used to teach my friends about linux, inform indiviudals on my projects that I build, and hopefully inspire everyone to make the switch to Linux. 

## The blog and myself
Kleinpanic is my name. Kernelpanic is my game. I am in College as of this blog post, and hopefully for the coming year I will continue to be. I am not a comp sci student. I am a neuroscience student interested in Medicine, but I have a love and a passion for comp sci and I do plan on adding it as my minor. I love computer science, and if I am able to make the switch to linux, anyone is. 
Anyways this blog is just going to be about whatever I want to post. Future posts will have more strucutre and will be about my projects, my videos, or explicit things of that nature and hopefully will be more entertaining to read. 

**P.S** If you are reading this, I love you, thank you for checking out my site, and my blog. Consider subbing to the RSS feed. 9.3
